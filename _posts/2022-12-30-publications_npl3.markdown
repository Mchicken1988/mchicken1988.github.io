Our paper about the role of Npl3 in nuclear mRNP assembly is out in
[Nucleic Acids Research](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac1206). We could
show that Npl3 is required for the recruitment and transfer of mRNP
components to mRNAs and that the two RNA-binding domains and their linker
contribute to the function of Npl3 in different ways.
