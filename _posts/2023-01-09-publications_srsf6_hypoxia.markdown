Our paper on SRSF6 as a key factor in the alternative splicing response to
hypoxia is out in [Nucleic Acids Research](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac1225).
We could show that the reduction of SRSF6 levels under acute hypoxia is
necessay to decrease the inclusion of numerous cassette exons and to trigger
the dispersal of nuclear speckles. Downregulation of SRSF6 is achieved
via the inclusion of a poison cassette exon promoted by SRSF4. Abolishment
of SRSF6 reduction resulted in increased proliferation, genomic instability
and suppresion of the stress response.
