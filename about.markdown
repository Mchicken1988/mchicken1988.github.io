My name is Mario Keller and I'm working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the 
Buchmann Institute For Molecular Life Sciences in the [Computational RNA
Biology Group](XXX) led by Dr. Kathi Zarnack. The focus of my work is on
RNA-binding proteins and their role in post-transcriptional regulation.

I made my PhD in the lab of [Prof. Dr. Enrico Schleiff](XXX) where I focused
on transcriptome and proteome adaptation during the development and
heat stress response of tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*) pollen.
