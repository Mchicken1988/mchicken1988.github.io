My name is Mario Keller and I am working as a postdoctoral Researcher at the 
Buchmann Institute For Molecular Life Sciences in the [Computational RNA Biology Group](https://www.bmls.de/Computational_RNA_Biology/aboutus.html)
headed by Dr. Kathi Zarnack. The focus of my work is on RNA-binding proteins
and their role in post-transcriptional regulation.

I did my PhD in the lab of [Prof. Dr. Enrico Schleiff](https://www.bio.uni-frankfurt.de/43969246/Abt__Schleiff),
where I focused on transcriptome and proteome adaptation during development
and heat stress response of tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*) pollen.
